# Temporal .NET SDK Build Tools

While the Temporal .NET SDK is in Alpha, this repo contains some of the required build tools. In the long term, the [main .NET SDK repo](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet) will be self-sufficient.

The reason for splitting up these tools into a separate repo is that we want to avoid making the Git history large by including large files (including binary files) that we know are not required in the long term.
